# Video Caption Management App

A simple React app that allows users to manage video captions with time synchronization. The app uses `react-player` for video playback and provides a straightforward interface for adding and editing captions.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: A fast and optimized build tool for React projects.
- **TypeScript**: To add static typing for better developer experience and error reduction.
- **react-toastify**: For real-time notifications and feedback.
- **react-player**: A React component for handling video playback.

## Features

- **Video Playback**: Users can play videos using `react-player`.
- **Caption Management**: Add, edit, and synchronize captions with video time.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures correct time synchronization for captions.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays toast notifications using `react-toastify` for key actions like adding and editing captions.

## Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### Video Playback
- **Decision**: Used `react-player` to handle video playback. This saved development time and avoided the complexity of building a custom player from scratch.
- **Trade-off**: Introduced an external dependency to the project.

### Caption State Management
- **Decision**: Managed captions using React state, which is simple and works for the current implementation.
- **Trade-off**: As the dataset grows, managing captions using React state may face performance issues. A future optimization might require using Redux or Context API for better scalability.

### User Interaction
- **Decision**: Created a basic form to add and edit captions, with validation for ensuring correct time synchronization.
- **Trade-off**: A more advanced interface (like a timeline-based editor) could provide better usability but would add complexity to the application.

### Notifications
- **Decision**: Integrated `react-toastify` for providing feedback to users.
- **Trade-off**: Overusing notifications could be annoying to users, so the notifications are kept minimal and only appear for key actions.

## User Experience Considerations

- **Minimal and Intuitive Interface**: Focus on making the interface simple and easy to use with key actions visible.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Notifications provide immediate feedback to the user during video playback or when captions are added/edited.
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation ensures captions are synchronized properly to avoid mistakes.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Caption Editing**: Adding a timeline-based editor for easier syncing of captions with the video.
- **Multiple Video Format Support**: Allow users to upload videos in different formats or subtitle files.
- **State Management**: Transition from React state to Redux or Context API for better performance and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Add user profiles and a system to save captions for future use.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the app is fully responsive and works smoothly on mobile devices.
